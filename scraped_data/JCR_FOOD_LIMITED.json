Photo: UCDSU Una Kelly | Online News Editor A daily diet of beans on toast and chicken fillet rolls may become a thing of the past as Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union and the student committee of the JCR Halls accommodation facility team up to launch Clever Cuisine Trinity. The scheme will provide four healthy and sizeable meals a week for students for €10. The initiative, which is to begin after the Christmas break, will work together with wholesalers M&K Meats Ltd to provide weekly packs of four easy to cook meals made from fresh meat, potatoes and vegetables. Students can order the packages online for up to four weeks at once and the website – CleverCuisine.ie – will feature recipies specific to the meals provided as well as food-handling advice. ADVERTISEMENT The packages will consist of fresh ingredients and recipes for four meals, and will be delivered en masse once a week to Trinity Halls for those students who order online before the Friday evening deadline. Students will then print out the receipts and collect them in person at the pre-arranged time. First launched in UCD over the summer, the idea sprang from a UCD Students’ Union survey of 500 UCD students, in which 81% said that they had skipped meals over the previous month in order to afford unavoidable college costs. The survey also found that students were moving away from home-cooked, nutritious meals towards unhealthy, cheaper junk food. The scheme is being organised in Trinity by Jack Leahy, SU Finance and Services Officer, David Henry, JCR Halls President, Tiarnan McCaughan, JCR Vice President and Treasurer, and Rosa Langhammer, SU Student Finances Committee member. Deliveries will only be made to Trinity Hall because the Students’ Union does not have the necessary facilities to store large amounts of food. Non-residents will still be able to avail of the deal and non-students can do so for a higher price of €12. Of the extra €2 paid, €1 of that will go towards funding the JCR committee’s activities. The initial meeting with Michael Bermingham, owner of M&K Meats Ltd, was facilitated by UCDSU Welfare officer Michéal Gallagher. Bermingham has been invited by Leahy to address members of SU Council this evening to detail the intricacies of the scheme. Onwards from its launch, the scheme will be managed by the JCR Halls committee. The company are flexible and willing to accommodate particular dietary requirements based on allergy and religious beliefs. Speaking to The University Times , JCR Halls President David Henry praised what he sees as a ‘fantastic opportunity’ for the students that he represents: “This is a fanta"

The appointments were made in respect of GNC Well Ireland Unlimited Company, and the related THSD Unlimited Company which has 86 full and part time employees. The businesses traded under the ‘The Health Food Store’ brand in respect of ten stores, and as “GNC” in respect of one store. The companies are part of the US-based GNC group, a health food retailer that operates over 4,000 stores in 50 different countries. The 11 Irish stores are located in Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, while the firms’ head office is based in Nutgrove Park in Rathfarnham, Dublin. The High Court heard that the Irish businesses have loss making in recent years, and were deemed by its parent as unlikely to become profitable and commercially sustainable. Following a strategic review of the businesses by the parent, which had been supporting the firms by way of intercompany loans, said it was no longer prepared to provide any further financial support, which the firms required in order to continue to trade.. On Wednesday, Mr Justice Liam Kennedy said he was satisfied to appoint Nicholas O’Dwyer and John Boland of Grant Thornton as joint provisional liquidators of the related companies. The judge said that based on the evidence put before the court, he was satisfied that it was "
