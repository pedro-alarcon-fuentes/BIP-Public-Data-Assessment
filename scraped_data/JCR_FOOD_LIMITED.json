        "text": "JCR Halls Set for Clever Cuisine Launch – The University Times The University Times Dec 18, 2012 JCR Halls Set for Clever Cuisine Launch First launched in UCD over the summer, the idea sprang from a UCD Students’ Union survey of 500 UCD students, in which 81% said that they had skipped meals over the previous month in order to afford unavoidable college costs. Photo: UCDSU Una Kelly | Online News Editor A daily diet of beans on toast and chicken fillet rolls may become a thing of the past as Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union and the student committee of the JCR Halls accommodation facility team up to launch Clever Cuisine Trinity. The scheme will provide four healthy and sizeable meals a week for students for €10. The initiative, which is to begin after the Christmas break, will work together with wholesalers M&K Meats Ltd to provide weekly packs of four easy to cook meals made from fresh meat, potatoes and vegetables. Students can order the packages online for up to four weeks at once and the website – CleverCuisine.ie – will feature recipies specific to the meals provided as well as food-handling advice. ADVERTISEMENT The packages will consist of fresh ingredients and recipes for four meals, and will be delivered en masse once a week to Trinity Halls for those students who order online before the Friday evening deadline. Students will then print out the receipts and collect them in person at the pre-arranged time. First launched in UCD over the summer, the idea sprang from a UCD Students’ Union survey of 500 UCD students, in which 81% said that they had skipped meals over the previous month in order to afford unavoidable college costs. The survey also found that students were moving away from home-cooked, nutritious meals towards unhealthy, cheaper junk food. The scheme is being organised in Trinity by Jack Leahy, SU Finance and Services Officer, David Henry, JCR Halls President, Tiarnan McCaughan, JCR Vice President and Treasurer, and Rosa Langhammer, SU Student Finances Committee member. Deliveries will only be made to Trinity Hall because the Students’ Union does not have the necessary facilities to store large amounts of food. Non-residents will still be able to avail of the deal and non-students can do so for a higher price of €12. Of the extra €2 paid, €1 of that will go towards funding the JCR committee’s activities. The initial meeting with Michael Bermingham, owner of M&K Meats Ltd, was facilitated by UCDSU Welfare officer Michéal Gallagher. Bermingham has been invited by Leahy to address members of SU Council this evening to detail the intricacies of the scheme. Onwards from its launch, the scheme will be managed by the JCR Halls committee. The company are flexible and willing to accommodate particular dietary requirements based on allergy and religious beliefs. Speaking to The University Times , JCR Halls President David Henry praised what he sees as a ‘fantastic opportunity’ for the students that he represents: “This is a fanta"
