The food served in fast-food restaurants is typically part of a \" meat-sweet diet \", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away , though seating may be provided. Fast-food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \"fast food\" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951. [ 1 ] While the first fast-food restaurant in the United States was a White Castle in 1921, [ 2 ] fast-food restaurants had been operating elsewhere much earlier, such as the Japanese fast food company Yoshinoya , started in Tokyo in 1899. [ 3 ] Today, American-founded fast-food chains such as McDonald's ( est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe. Variations on the fast-food restaurant concept include fast-casual restaurants and catering trucks . Fast-casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast-food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.
